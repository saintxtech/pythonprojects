---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `import random` / `import string` → secure randomness + character sets
- `input()` → getting user preferences
- `if`, `+=`, `string manipulation` → building a custom character pool
- `random.choices()` → selecting multiple random characters
- `''.join()` → converting a list into a single password string
- Input validation with `try`, `exit()`, and conditions
