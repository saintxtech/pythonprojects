# 🎲 Dice Roller + Streak Tracker - Python CLI Project

A simple yet fun Python script that simulates dice rolls and tracks how many times the same number is rolled in a row (a "streak").

---

## 🎯 Features

- Rolls a virtual 6-sided die
- Tracks streaks of repeated rolls (e.g., three 6s in a row)
- Exits cleanly when the user types `'q'`
- Great for practicing `while` loops and state tracking

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `random.randint()` → generate dice roll (1–6)
- `while True:` loop → keeps rolling until quit
- `input()` → user interaction
- Variables → `streak`, `previous_roll` to track state
- `if` / `else` logic → handle streaks and resets
- `break` → clean exit from infinite loop

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python dice_roller.py

Then:

Press Enter to roll the die

Type 'q' to quit
